            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
              I love writing code, Ever since I have implemented my first
              program in C++ that draws different shapes using stars and
              manipulated it to get the desired output, I have been obsessed
              with the idea of using Software to solve practical problems. I
              consider Software development is never-ending tutorials that I'm
              engaged with and having the desire for more and more. I believe
              that Programming came with nothing but good, ease, and a new era
              for healthier people.

                <p>
                  3 years ago, It was my first year at Ain-Shams University
                  Faculty of Computer and Information Science. I heard about{" "}
                  <a href="https://icpc.global/">ACM ICPC</a> and it was very
                  interesting for me, So I started my training program with my
                  colleagues and a mentor. Over the time I studied Machine
                  learning and AI any by a short time I was completely obsessed
                  with them. So I thought to craft my Graduation Project around
                  ML and AI.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We met and brainstormed to get an idea, I was inspired by
                  Shazam and how it works. Then we came to an idea, Why we don't
                  make an application like shazam but especially created for
                  Quran and use machine learning to remove limitations and
                  restrictions to a specific voice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We started researching for 3 months then we made our decision
                  and put a plan for the upcoming 6 months. every one of us was
                  responsible for a specific part. we had the core engine team,
                  mobile team and UI/UX team. I should say it was very hrd at
                  the beginning as no one worked on this field before, we will
                  work with signals and ML plus we wanted to provide seamless
                  experience through providing a mobile app that anybody can
                  use, and we were restricted by a time frame. But eventually we
                  made it ðŸ’ª and we got <strong>A+</strong> in the project. We
                  crafted a mobile app that can work online and offline just
                  pronounce word or two from the verse you want and it will be
                  there for you. We named it{" "}
